The way that we have set up the Cloudinary config method is to 
insert an object that contains the cloud_name, api_key and api_secret.  
Because all of this is sensitive information, its donâ€™t advised adding
the configuration as plain text which is how the dotenv tool will aid 
in the process. It can use the environment tables to find the information 
by adding a .env file into the root directory along with this code.
